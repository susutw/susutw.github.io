            <p>I enjoy engaging in open-source communities. Since 2018, I have been volunteering for the COSCUP program
                team. COSCUP is an annual conference organized by the Taiwanese open-source community participants since
                2006. In 2023, I founded the COSCUP booth team and attended FOSDEM and FOSSAISA, aiming to raise more
                awareness about COSCUP and encourage participation in our events.</p>
            <p>I am also a travel enthusiast, and my favorite quote is 'You don’t know what you don’t know.' There’s
                always something new to discover as long as you keep exploring, sparking inspiration in unexpected ways.
